# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this project is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Identifying and reporting this information will allow stakeholders to prepare for the "silver tsunami" as employees for the company approach retirement age. 

## Results 

There are four major points from the completed analysis: 
- The job titles in the retirement pool are: Senior Engineer, Senior Staff, Engineer, Staff, Technique Leader, Assistant Engineer, Manager
- The top 3 job titles most impacted by the incoming retirement "silver tsunami" are Senior Engineer, Senior Staff, and Engineer.

## Summary 

*How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?*

The roles required to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact are the following: Senior Engineer, Senior Staff, Engineer, Staff, Technique Leader, Assistant Engineer, Manager.

- The first query I added to provide more insight into the analysis was the query to generate a list of mentor-ready employees from the mentorship_eligibility table
- insert query

- A second query that may provide more insight is
